Our project mainly uses an API regarding the news from New York Times. 
We have used Python as a language to create an application to read the API where we parse the JSON data and run basic parameterized queries on the same. 

In total there are 4 main files in our project:
1. jsonParser.py : Parses the data and creates 3 different CSVs namely news.csv, media.csv and media_info.csv.
2. createDb.py : Here the data from CSVs is used to create a SQL database named news.db.
3. queries.py : The user is supposed to input the data based on the criteria to get respective data by running a couple of queries.
4. testJsonParser: Performs Unit test for news.csv and media.csv data files.
